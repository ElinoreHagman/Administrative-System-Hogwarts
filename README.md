# Administrative-System-Hogwarts
School assignment, spring 2019

Java application made in Netbeans together with a MySQL database. The system is used by teachers and students alike, but they have different functions they can use. The students can only check information, like their grades, courses and see the House Cup score. The teachers can either be normal teachers or admins and that is stored in the database so when they log in they get a different home page. Teachers can add, change and remove students, courses and grades, and more.

It works without any exceptions errors.
